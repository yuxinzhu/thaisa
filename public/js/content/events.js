// 	"description": "Thank you so much to all our members who have come out to our general TASA events and family events to show their support. Without each and every one of you, TASA would not have grown into the organization that it is today. As further thanks, we'd like to invite you for our last TASA event of the semester. Join us for a day outside and we'll be playing games alongside the fresh air. We'll be serving TASA's classic minced pork noodles along with other snacks for all our guests to enjoy. Best of all, this event is totally free for all members.",
